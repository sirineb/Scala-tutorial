# Scala Cheat Sheet
## Scala as a langage
Scala is a hybrid functional programming language. Scala integrates the features of object-oriented and functional languages. Scala is compiled to run on the Java Virtual Machine.
### Scala is object-oriented
Scala is a pure object-oriented language in the sense that every value is an object. Types and behavior of objects are described by classes and traits.
### Scala is functional
Scala is also a functional language in the sense that every function is a value and every value is an object so ultimately every function is an object.
### Scala is statically typed
Scala does not expect you redundant type information. You don't have to specify a type in most cases, and you certainly don't have to repeat it.
### Scala runs on the JVM
Scala is compiled into Java Bytecode which is executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This means that Scala and Java have a common runtime platform.
### Scala can Execute Java Code
Scala enables using all the classes of the Java SDK and custom Java classes, or Java open source projects.
### Scala can do Concurrent & Synchronize processing
Scala allows expressing general programming patterns in an effective way. It reduces the number of lines and helps the programmer to code in a type-safe way. It allows writing codes in an immutable manner, which makes it easy to apply concurrency and parallelism (Synchronize).
